          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my website.</h1>
          <p>Since the age of 17, coding and problem solving has been the main passion of my life as the act of using scripts and codes to solve a problem gives me unparallel amounts of joy and satisfaction. Being able to solve any problems by using the power of codes and softwares is the goal I strive to reach as I continously learn to upgrade myself and my skills through self learning and online courses.</p>

          <p>With this I will keep honing my skills practically by challenging myself in various different personal projects while also participating in several other coperate or community projects as well. When I take on a project not only do I do my best in ensuring the project is able to reach its goal but also try to take away all the learnings and lessons garnered from the project for continous self-improvement so that I will be better and better at my craft. </p>
